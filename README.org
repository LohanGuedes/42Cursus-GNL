Get Next Line Project for ecole42.
Because Reading a Line from a file descriptor is way too tedious.

** Summary:
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

** Goals:
This Project will allow me to add a very convenient function to my collection ([[https://github.com/LohanGuedes/libft][libft]]) but will also make me learn Static Variables and how to work with them.

** Project:
| Function name      | get_next_line                                                                         |
|--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prototype          | ~char *get_next_line(int fd)~                                                           |
| Turn in files      | fd: The file descriptorto read from                                                   |
| Return Value       | Read line: Correct behavior, ~NULL~: There is nothing else to read, or an error occured |
| External Functions | read, malloc, free                                                                    |
| Description        | Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.                     |
